# Check Docker Service Status

Before starting a project, you may need to check if Docker is even running. 

```Bash
sudo service docker status
```

If it's not running, then start 'er up:

```Bash
sudo service docker start
```

When you're done with the thing, take 'er down:

```Bash
sudo service docker stop
```
Yarr!
